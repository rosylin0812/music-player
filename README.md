### Music Player for Fan Bai (Buddhist Chanting) Practice

Link : https://fan-bai-player.vercel.app/

This modern web app is a dedicated music player for Fan Bai/ Buddhist Chanting practice.

It lets you organize songs and playlists exactly how you want with simple drag-and-drop, works fully offline, and saves everything permanently on your device. 

Clean, professional, and focused, it replaces scattered chat apps with one powerful space for all your practice audios—so you spend less time searching and more time practicing.

## 🚀 How to Install as a Mobile App (PWA)

This project is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, meaning you can install it directly from your browser—no app store needed!

Once the music player is deployed to a live link (like the Vercel URL above), follow these steps to install it on your mobile device:

### For iPhone / iPad Users (using Safari):

1.  **Open Safari:** Navigate to the live website link (e.g., `https://fanbia.vercel.app/`).
2.  **Tap Share:** Find the **Share button** ($\square \uparrow$) at the bottom of the screen.
3.  **Add to Home Screen:** Scroll down and select the option **"Add to Home Screen."**
4.  **Confirm:** Tap **"Add."**
    * *Result:* The app icon will appear on your home screen and open in a full-screen, dedicated app window.

### For Android Users (using Chrome):

1.  **Open Chrome:** Navigate to the live website link.
2.  **Tap Menu:** Tap the **Menu button** ($\vdots$) in the top-right corner.
3.  **Install App:** Select **"Install app"** (or sometimes **"Add to Home Screen"**).
4.  **Confirm:** Tap **"Install"** or **"Add."**
    * *Result:* The app icon will appear in your app drawer and on your home screen, running like a native app.

### Key Benefit: Offline Use

Once installed, the app works **completely offline**! You can:

* Upload your Buddhist chanting audio files.
* Manage and edit all your playlists.
* Play all local songs *without* needing an internet connection.
